This is a public free to use and (sometimes) free to edit repository of graphics for [Fire Emblem Rom Modding](https://feuniverse.us/t/fe-builder-gba-if-you-have-any-questions-attach-report7z/2845), [Tactile Game Creation](https://feuniverse.us/t/tactile-srpg-game-engine-and-fexna/10614), and [Lex Talionis](https://lt-maker.readthedocs.io/) game creation. There are probably other Fire Emblem game creation tools that can use the resources in this repository, too. For a comparison of the major engines, [here's an older post I wrote](https://feuniverse.us/t/romhacking-lex-talionis-tactile-and-srpg-studio-an-engine-comparison-post-which-game-creation-engine-will-best-suit-your-needs/17559) to demonstrate what the major Fire Emblem game creation kits each offer.

This repository contains: Portraits, battle animations, map sprites, music files, and countless other assorted resources people might like to use.

Want to access all the files for any given type quickly?

Install a ‘Markdown File Reader.’ [This one is for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl?hl=en-US), it’s what I use. There’s likely something appropriate for Firefox, Edge, or whatever you might use.

Now, just open a link to the resource you want to browse.

[Battle animations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo/main/Battle%20Animations/README.md).

[Portraits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo/main/Portrait%20Repository/README.md).

[Class Cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo/main/Class%20Cards/README.md).

[Map Sprites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo/main/Map%20Sprites/README.md).

[Item Icons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo/main/Item%20Icons/README.md).

[Maps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo/main/Maps/README.md).

[The entire BG Folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo/main/BGs%2C%20Interface%20Elements/README.md).

If you want Music Files for your project, you'll have to look at the [Music Repository](https://github.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo-Music), which is a separate repository and lacks internet previewing capabilities.

All battle animations are F2E. Many other resources are F2E, but some are only F2U. Not sure what that means? Check this thread for more info: 
https://feuniverse.us/t/regarding-graphics-assets/11550/5

Note that if something is not listed as F2E, it's probably F2U. That being said, I am a busy person and really don't have a lot of time to update thousands of files or compile walls of credits, hence you should view that topic if you're uncertain regarding some resource's usability. You can just assume a resource is F2U to be safe, but checking with the original creator for F2E permissions is preferable when unlisted.

If you go inside any specific animation's folder, you will also find credits for that animation at the bottom.

The Repository has previews for almost all graphical assets! Simply scroll down to the bottom of any related page and you'll see the Readme.md file generating previews for them.
