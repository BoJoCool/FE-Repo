Maps made by WhatIsAnAubin for a Private Hack. Resources created to be made public.

Notes:

Ch.5/8 - Rock and a hard place/Hey look a Trap
Like stock Sacred Stones, there's some slight overlap in the playable area.
Ch.8 Specifically
"Gay Baby Jail" in the bottom right. I put an Archer with Lunge in there.

Ch.13 - Moderate Conviction
I was still messing around with the best way to do a Full-Map Tilechange,
so the entirety of the edits are in Tilechange 0x0,
and all further tilechanges based on that.

Ch.13x - Raiding for Relics
"Is that Lo-"
There's a Tilechange on the Right Side where an entire wall gets blown down.
Do with that what you will.

Ch.16 - Ruled by Doge
A few extra tiles that didn't exist in the base tileset.
I humbly request anyone who uses this map to put a Fleet in the small indoor pool. Thank you.

Ch.21x - Fuck it. We Ball.
Unless you're doing the same joke or similar, this map is basically just stock Sacred Stones,
Included for completeness.

(The maps not included are actually just stock Sacred Stones.)
