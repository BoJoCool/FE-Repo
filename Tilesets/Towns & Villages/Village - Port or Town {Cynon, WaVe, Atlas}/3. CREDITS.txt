Made by Cynon for Atlas, using tiles made by WaVe and IS. Some FE7 ship tiles were brought over. As far as I'm concerned, it's free to edit.

Palettes by Atlas and Cynon included.

This tileset uses the same tile animation as the village tileset does (tile 12), but it's included in here just in case it's needed.
