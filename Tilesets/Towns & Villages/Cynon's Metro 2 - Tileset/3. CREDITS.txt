This is not a replacement for the other metropolis tileset I submitted awhile ago. This tileset allows for a much larger geographic space to be depicted without making maps larger than they need to be. In other words, if you want to show two east/west streets with 4 buildings on each street, you can use fewer tiles to do that with this tileset. You can theoretically use both metropolis tilesets in the same project at the same time, depending on your needs. It uses almost the exact same palettes (I think there's only one color on palette 1 that's different) that the other metropolis tileset does. This one is more... vanilla FE adjacent, if that makes any sense. There's a lot more variance in terrain types with this as well, so this might lead to more interesting maps from a gameplay perspective. While this works best for large urban areas, there's enough here for it to be usable for agricultural towns as well, I included some wheat field tiles to help with that. 

Battle platforms meant for this tileset can be found in the battle platforms section. Look for the Dark Cobblestone/Dirty Castle sets -- should be more than enough there, including train track platforms.

Tileset is not exactly finished but should be completely usable as-is. I would like to know about any uses of this tileset, so that I can see how people other than me use it to build maps. This will help me identify problems with it down the line and fix them and improve it. You're free to make whatever palette changes you like. 

I also endorse converting this tileset to be used in other engines.

Uses tiles adapted and modified from;
- Final Fantasy 4, 5, and 6 (SNES)
- Live-A-Live (SNES)
- RPG Maker 2000
- RPG Maker 2003
- Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal

Known issues;
- Not many one-story buildings.
- The one-story buildings look a little awkward next to the multistory buildings. This might be an unavoidable problem.
- Lack of space on the tileset for placing river tiles -- this can be solved without changing the object palette, but that might be for another tileset.
- West/East door tiles will look a bit awkward.
