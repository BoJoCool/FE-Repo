PLEASE READ BEFORE USING

Fast Long version is the one recommended for use.

OG version by Jeorge Reds, mostly unchanged. Essential fixes by Alice.

Fast version changes all 3-duration frames to 2. And the last 2 frames before the hit to 1-duration.

Fast Long version makes the last 4 non shrinking frames repeat so the animation lasts a bit longer.
