NOTE: Do NOT import any of the background images directly as an image!
That will break the image TSA and cause graphical errors!
You need to import them through palette editor.
In FeBuilder:

Advanced Editor -> Patches -> Demon King Image (Whole) -> PaletteEditor -> Import Image

The animations can be imported just like any other animation.

Please test that all works properly before saving!
