Made by Watching Dog.

This animation is sort of a Tier 3 animation for the Hellhound and Gwyllgi. However, as this one only has one head instead of three, I recommend using the Winged Cerberus variant instead.

For this animation, a solid promotion progression would be "Hellhound" followed by "Hellhound SM Crit +Wings". This way, the Hellhound's first promotion will give it wings when it crits, which will smoothly lead into the permanent wings for the Tier 3 Vampirehound.
