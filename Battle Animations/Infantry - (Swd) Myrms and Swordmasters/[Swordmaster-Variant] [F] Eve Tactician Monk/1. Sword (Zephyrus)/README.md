## Credit

A few sword frames are edited from FE7if Alice, though I believe that was originally from bwdyeti's swordmaster? May be mis-remembering.

Aside from that, made by VelvetKitsune.

Zephyrus uses 'spell cast' thing instead of normal hit in 1 range, so it casts spell attached to it when you attack, just a small difference.
