Animation by Obsidian Daddy.

Scripted by StrudelMuffin Maximus03 and Obsidian Daddy.

Special Thanks to Card, Leo_Link, and Feier for helping with the still and some frame adjustments.


Another thanks to Strudel and Maximus because without those two kings I wouldn't have been motivated to finish this animation.

Play KOFXV btw
