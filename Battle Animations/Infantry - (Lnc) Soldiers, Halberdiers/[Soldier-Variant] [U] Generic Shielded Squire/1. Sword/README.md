Animations inspired by the Squire Animation.

Now revamped and modified by Dark and now called 'Generic Shielded Squire'.

Some sprites were used as base, considering original credits: Grin.

These people may be involved since they did small modifications in the original animation: Russell Clark, Maiser6.

A big thanks to Deryk Reus Donda for giving the idea of creating a generic shield, now people can create flags or drawings in the knight's shield.
